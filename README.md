# hello-world
Trying to learn a little more about coding.
I am a father and husband to a beautiful wife and daughter.  My daughter is only 8 months old, but I want to make sure she has the best life I can provide.  Because of that, I feel like it is important to expand my bailiwick to encompass more lucrative skills.  I don't know if this will fit into that category, but it won't hurt.  Also, I want to be able to guide my daughter in whatever path she decides to go, be it art, STEM, or otherwise.
